// Hardware named (split) barriers, gfx1250 and later.
//
// A named barrier lets a subset of a workgroup's waves rendezvous without dragging in the
// other waves, which is what separates a producer/consumer pipeline from a ping-pong one:
// the loader waves can run ahead instead of meeting the compute waves at a workgroup
// barrier every K step.
//
// ABI, as emitted by the gfx1250 backend (established by compile probe, not by published
// documentation -- see the UNVERIFIED note on named_barrier_signal before relying on it):
//   - The compiler assigns ids, not the programmer: within a kernel, the i'th element of a
//     named barrier array is id i+1. Numbering restarts per kernel, so two kernels may each
//     size their array independently.
//   - S_BARRIER_INIT takes m0 = (member_count << 16) | id; S_BARRIER_JOIN takes the bare id in
//     m0's low bits. Both are materialised by the backend from the barrier object.
//   - S_BARRIER_SIGNAL and S_BARRIER_WAIT encode the id as a literal, so ids must be
//     compile-time constants and cannot be recovered from the object.
//   - Named barriers are a separate hardware pool and cost no group-segment bytes. A kernel
//     reserves ceil(extent / 4) groups, driven by the array's EXTENT, not by how many
//     barriers it actually uses -- so the array is sized to the pipeline, not to the
//     hardware maximum.
//
// Why a kernel may hold only one array. Ids are handed out per array in allocation order,
// which the front end cannot observe, so a second array leaves S_BARRIER_SIGNAL/WAIT pointing
// at the first array's ids while INIT/JOIN follow the second's -- a silent hang plus
// corruption of the other array's barriers. No static_assert can see the allocation, so the
// rule is enforced through the type system instead: every ring operation requires a token that
// only named_barrier_pipeline::init() can mint, and init() only accepts a kernel that names
// this pipeline via
//
//     using barrier_pipeline = ck_tile::named_barrier_pipeline<...>;
//
// So a kernel cannot signal barriers it never reserved, and cannot drive a second pipeline it
// never armed. The unit is the kernel because that is the hardware's unit -- two kernels may
// each size their array independently.
//
// That defends ck_tile's own uses. A __shared__ __amdgpu_named_workgroup_barrier_t[] declared
// anywhere else in the same kernel reintroduces the defect exactly, and nothing can catch it.
//
// Deliberately NOT ck_tile::static_counter: a counter allocates bases in instantiation order,
// so the same pipeline type would get different ids in different TUs -- an ODR violation on its
// own members, and strictly worse than a collision that at least reproduces.
//
// Usage. One producer wave feeding one consumer wave over a 2-slot ring:
//
//     template <typename Pipe>
//     struct my_kernel
//     {
//         using barrier_pipeline = Pipe;                 // required: names this kernel's pipeline
//         using ring             = typename Pipe::template ring<0>;
//
//         CK_TILE_DEVICE void operator()(...) const
//         {
//             if constexpr(ring::kIsSupported)           // must be template context to discard
//             {
//                 __shared__ T slots[kNumSlots][kElems]; // barriers cost no LDS; slots do
//                 const auto bar = Pipe::template init<my_kernel>();   // collective, once
//
//                 if(wave_is_producer)
//                 {

//                     // drained, so wait() would block on a generation the consumer cannot
//                     // complete. Retire the stores before publishing.
//                     fill(0); __threadfence_block(); prod::template prime<0>(bar);
//                     fill(1); __threadfence_block(); prod::template prime<1>(bar);

//                     {

//                 }

//                 {
//                     using cons = typename ring::consumer;

// same number of steps; keep every ring call wave-uniform; producer<P> is a ROLE, so the caller
// must map exactly one wave to each P.

 * ahead, so their DMA overlaps the consumers' math instead of meeting it at a workgroup
 * barrier every step.
 *
 * Reachable only as named_barrier_pipeline::ring<I>, which is what guarantees the BaseId
 * values tile the pool without overlapping.
 *
 * Barrier layout, ids ascending from BaseId:
 *   DATA[s]      producers signal, consumers wait      -- slot s is filled
 *   FREE[p][s]   consumers signal, producer p waits    -- slot s is drained
 *
 * FREE is per producer rather than shared. With one shared FREE per slot, a consumer signal
 * can complete the generation on behalf of a producer that is running behind, releasing
 * whichever producer happened to be joined and hanging the others.
 *
 * Member counts are chosen so the waiting side is always a required signaller, which is what
 * rules out a wave waiting on a generation it never joined.
 *
 * Required call sequence. A producer must fill each slot's first generation with prime(), not
 * wait(): on the first pass nothing has been drained yet, so a wait() would block on a FREE
 * generation the consumers cannot complete until that same producer has filled the slot.
 *
 *   producer:  [fill slot s; prime<s>() for every s]  then  { wait; fill; publish } per step
 *   consumer:  { wait; drain; release } per step
 *
 * Neither side may leave the loop early. A wave that returns without signalling the
 * generations its peers are waiting on hangs them, and a wave cannot retroactively signal a
 * generation it has left. Ragged K must be handled by driving every wave through the same
 * number of steps. The converse is expected and harmless: after the last step each FREE
 * barrier holds unmatched consumer signals, because the producer has already left.
 *
 * Producer<P> is a role, not an identity: nothing binds P to the calling wave. Two waves that
 * both instantiate producer<0> leave FREE[1][*] with no waiter and hang. The caller owns that
 * mapping.
 *
 * Every call must be wave-uniform. S_BARRIER_* are scalar and execute regardless of EXEC, so a
 * call under a partially divergent branch signals from a wave that should not have.
