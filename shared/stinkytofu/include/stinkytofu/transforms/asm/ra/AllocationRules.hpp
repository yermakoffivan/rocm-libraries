// What one architecture requires of a register allocation.
//
// A rule is one row in a table: a name, a status, and exactly one function
// saying what it forbids or what it prefers. Which function you fill in decides
// what kind of rule it is, and that is the only decision to make:
//
//   forbidsBase    a value may not sit at some index         (hard)
//   clobbersEarly  an instruction writes before it reads     (hard)
//   addRelations   two values sit at a fixed offset          (hard)
//   baseCost       an index is legal but worse               (soft)
//   addPreferences two values would rather share a register  (soft)
//
// A pairing rule fills in addPreferences and, as its companion, satisfiedBy:
// one collects the pairs and the other judges them, and a rule with only one of
// them is a table mistake. Everything else is still exactly one function.
//
// To add a rule, append a row. Nothing else changes: the queries below walk the
// table and skip rules that are not Active, so a rule never tests its own
// status, and a policy never sees a rule or an architecture at all.
// An unregistered triple yields an empty table.
// See docs/developer/register-allocation.md §14.
